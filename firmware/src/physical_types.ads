   --  You may notice a lot of math similar to 5.0**(1/2) here when using the below types. This may seem like it should
   --  be evaluated as 5.0**(1/2) = 5.0**0 = 1.0, which it would be under normal circumstances, but GNAT does some
   --  magic to evaluate it as 5.0**0.5 and keeps the dimensions intact. If porting this to a different Ada compiler
   --  then you will have to use ** from Ada.Numerics.Generic_Elementary_Functions and replace all the rationals with
   --  floating point literals.
